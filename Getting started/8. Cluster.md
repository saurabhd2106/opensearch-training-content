A Cluster must have one or more nodes

These nodes work together to share data and work load

One of the node in the cluster is selected as a master node

The master node is responsible for creating and deleting the indexes and is also responsible for adding or removing a node from the cluster

The master node need not to be involved in any document level changes or searches bcz if the traffic goes up it will be bottle neck for the master node

In the cluster any node can become the master

If the cluster has one node that single node performs the master node

We can talk to any node in the cluster including the master node

Every node knows where each document lives in the cluster and it can forward our request directly to the node that has the document

If we talk to node1 in the cluster, may be our data is in some other node and its node1 responsibility to redirect our request to the other node and return the final response to us. This all is managed by Open Search

Shards

Open search divides index in shards that holds just a slice of all the data in the index
Shards are nothing but lucene index
So one open search index is made up of multiple lucene indexes
Open Search uses the core library of the apache lucene index internally to index the data
These shards are distributed accross the multiple nodes
Shards are allocated to the nodes in the cluster

When the cluster grows, open search will automatically migrate the shards between the nodes so that the cluster remains balanced

The simplest open search cluster has only one node, when you start adding more nodes to the cluster existing shards gets balanced in the multiple nodes and the open search gets additional power to index and query the data

This process is nothing but horizontal scaling

There is another type of scaling and that is vertical scaling i.e. adding more resources to your node like increasing RAM size or increasing processor but vertical scaling is not cost effective


A shard can either be a primary shard or a replica shard
Each document in your index belong to a single primary shard. So the number of primary shard you have determine the maximum amount of data that index can hold.

For example if you index 100 blogs in your index blogpost and you define the number of shard as five.

Then these 100 documents are stored in these 5 shards (20 documents per shard)

If your cluster has more than one node then these shards are stored in between the nodes

The data we store in the index are physically stored in these shards but our application can't talk to these shards directly instead they talk to index 

When you create an index, you can specify how many primary shards you need for your index & also you can specify how many replica shards you need for your primary shards 

A replica shard is just a copy of primary shards and are defined to protect the data from the hardware failure and to serve the requests like searching or retrieving the document

PUT /blogpost

{
    "settings" : {
        "number_of_shards" : 2,
        "number_of_replicas" : 1
    }
}

This will create index with 2 primary shards and 1 replica shard for each primary shard 

Total number of shards = 4 (2 Primary and 2 Replica)

The primary shard number is fixed at the time index is created but replica shards can be modified any time 

Let say the primary shards are P0 and P1, replica shards are R0 and R1 

P0 and R0 will have the same data but will not store in the same node, similarly P1 and R1 will have the same data but will not store in the same node

Primary shards and Replica shards if live in the same node then there is no logic as the reason to have replica shards is to provide redundancy

If one node fails then both the primary and replica shards will be gone as they are in same node

Shards are decided on the basis of document ID and are not stored randomly in the shards. The logic to assign the document to shards is 

    = hash (routing) % (mode) number of shards

    routing value is an arbitrary string the default value is the document Id but it can also be set to a custom value 

    At any time each node can serve the search query if the other node goes down

    Replica nodes can only do the search query and are not used for indexing the data. To update or delete the document we must talk to primary shards

    More number of the replicas you have more search throughput you can handle

    PUT /blogpost/_settings
    {
        "number_of_replicas" : 2
    }

While indexing a document if the primary shards that suppose to save the document is unavailable then the master node will save the request for a certain time period and if that primary shard doesnot come up within that time the master node will timeout (default time 60 sec)
